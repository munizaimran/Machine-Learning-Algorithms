# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A few basic ML algorithms commonly used by beginners in ML and Data Analysis

These are the basic outlines necessary to create a Machine Learning and Data Analysis project. I have added the following algorithms in this repository:

1. Decision Tree Algorithm
2. Naive Bayes Classification (Guassian Algorithm)
3. K-Means Clustering
4. K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
5.  Linear Regression Algorithm
6. Logistic Regression
